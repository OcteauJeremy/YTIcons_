                    <p>YTIcons is first of all a game where you can buy, collect and sell your favorite YouTuber cards (YTIcons). We released it for multiple purposes :</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>- To provide a game to the cryptocurrency’s community.</li>
                      <li>- To donate to a charity carefully chosen : for each YTIcon’s transaction, 3% of the share is directly sent to an address (especially created for this purpose) if the YTIcon has not been verified by the concerned YouTuber, else, it will directly be sent to the YouTuber’s chosen ETH address (which also might be a charity fund).</li>
                      <li>- To invest : every time you buy a YTIcon, its price is re-calculated by our algorithm so as to increase and the YTIcon is immediately put back on sale in the marketplace. If someone else wants to buy it, they will have to pay you more than the amount you originally invested in ETH.</li>

                    <p>In contrary of other similar cryptocurrencies projects, the donations are directly stored — through our Smart Contract — to an address with this specific purpose.</p>
                    <p>Finally, since a lot of the existing charities and organisations serve different purposes to make the world a better place, we will notify you through our Twitter (<b><a href="https://twitter.com/YT_Icons" target="_blank">@YT_Icons</a></b>) every time a change has been decided or when a donation has been done through this address so you can track it off thanks to the blockchain.</p>
