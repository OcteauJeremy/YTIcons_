              We charge a 8% commission on every transaction conducted on our Site and in our Game in addition to the Gas charged by the Ethereum network. 3% of this commission is reserved for charity donations or royalties paid to the concerned youtuber. By using our Site and our App, and by purchasing a youtuber Smart Contract, you acknowledge this and agree that the commission will be transferred directly to us through the Ethereum network. We do not charge this fee for interactions that do not occur on our App’s marketplace. <br><br>
