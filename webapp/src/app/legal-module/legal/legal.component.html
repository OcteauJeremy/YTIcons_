              <p>For us, it is important to inform (but also reassure) you on few aspects related to our platform.</p>

              <p>First of all, <b>YTIcons</b> is legal and we are constantly working so it stays that way. To put it simply :</p>

              <ul>
                <li>- We do not act on any YouTuber’s behalf and we absolutely do not intend to either.</li>
                <li>- We do not use any YouTuber’s name, reputation, status or likeness for commercial purposes and again, we do not intend to either.</li>
                <li>- It is legal to sell pictures or names of any person as long as it is not used to promote a product or a service.</li>
              </ul>
              <br/>
              <p>We do consider that any YouTuber has the right to get royalties, this is why we endeavor in getting partnerships before any related YTIcon’s release.
              On the other hand, we try to provide our community a playable game so it is still possible to (hopefully temporary) see an unverified YTIcon :
              in this specific case and as long as the process of getting a partnership lasts, 3% of every transaction will be sent to an address created for charities’ purpose.</p>
